# 🌌 3D Solar System 

This project is a mobile-responsive 3D simulation of the solar system, created using Three.js. It visually represents all eight planets orbiting the Sun with realistic motion, lighting, and interactive controls.

📌 Features

- Sun at the center with glowing emissive light

-  All 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune) with relative sizes and distances

-  Planetary orbits animated using frame-based logic

-  Speed Control Panel: Adjust the orbital speed of each planet in real time

-  Saturn ring modeled for extra realism

-  Planet name labels that follow the camera

-  Starfield background created using custom geometry

-  Orbit rings drawn for each planet

-  Realistic lighting: Ambient and point light from the sun

-  Camera orbit animation around the solar system

-  Fully responsive design: works on all screen sizes

-  No CSS animations used, only JavaScript + Three.js

🧪 Technologies Used

Three.js (WebGL library)

HTML, JavaScript (No frameworks)
