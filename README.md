# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is a mobile-responsive 3D simulation of the solar system, created using Three.js. It visually represents all eight planets orbiting the Sun with realistic motion, lighting, and interactive controls.

📌 Features

☀️ Sun at the center with glowing emissive light

🪐 All 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune) with relative sizes and distances

🔁 Planetary orbits animated using frame-based logic

🎛 Speed Control Panel: Adjust the orbital speed of each planet in real time

🌕 Saturn ring modeled for extra realism

📍 Planet name labels that follow the camera

🌌 Starfield background created using custom geometry

🌀 Orbit rings drawn for each planet

💡 Realistic lighting: Ambient and point light from the sun

🎥 Camera orbit animation around the solar system

📱 Fully responsive design: works on all screen sizes

✅ No CSS animations used, only JavaScript + Three.js

🧪 Technologies Used

Three.js (WebGL library)

HTML, JavaScript (No frameworks)

📱 Mobile Responsiveness

Canvas resizes dynamically

Speed controller layout adjusts for smaller screens
